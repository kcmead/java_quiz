# Java Quiz

## Description

I created a simple quiz game to test your knowledge of JavaScript.  The page is set to load up with questions, once an answer is entered it is scored and then the next question populates.  At the end of the quiz, the user's score is tallied and associated with the initials that are entered upon submission.

## Usage

This website is intended to be a learning exercise for the things I've been learning in javascript as the course progresses.  There be some more updates in the future as I learn more.
